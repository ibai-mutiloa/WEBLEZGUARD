#LEZGUARD

Cities today are increasingly grappling with the dual challenges of traffic congestion and environmental pollution. As vehicles on the roads emit significant levels of greenhouse gases and harmful pollutants, urban areas are witnessing deteriorating air quality and escalating climate change impacts. In response to these pressing issues, many municipalities around the world have turned to Low Emission Zones (LEZ) as a strategic solution to curb emissions and promote sustainable urban mobility. 

However, the journey to implementing an effective LEZ is far from straightforward. The process unfolds in several distinct phases, each presenting unique challenges that must be addressed systematically. The planning phase involves understanding traffic patterns and emissions data, identifying high-pollution areas, and consulting with stakeholders to ensure equitable and practical solutions. This is followed by the design phase, where municipalities establish emission standards, define zone boundaries, and predict the potential impact of various policy measures. 

Next comes the implementation phase, which requires deploying infrastructure such as cameras, sensors, and signage to monitor compliance. This step also involves creating systems to identify vehicles and assess their emissions in real-time. Finally, the monitoring and evaluation phase ensures that the LEZ achieves its objectives, using continuous data collection to assess its impact and refine policies where necessary. 

Despite the clear structure of these phases, a major challenge persists: there is no single tool or product capable of supporting municipalities throughout the entire LEZ implementation process. Most existing solutions are piecemeal, offering isolated functionalities such as license plate recognition or emissions analysis, but lacking the integration required for seamless decision-making and management. This fragmented approach often results in inefficiencies, increased costs, and gaps in implementation, making it harder for cities to achieve their environmental goals. 

Recognizing this gap, the "Lez Guard" application was developed as an innovative solution to simplify and enhance the LEZ implementation process. Designed to function as a comprehensive tool, "Lez Guard" integrates cutting-edge technologies to address challenges at every stage. The application utilizes webcam-based license plate recognition to identify vehicles within a specific area and employs predictive modeling to estimate their emissions. By analyzing data from previous days, "Lez Guard" provides municipalities with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions to reduce emissions and optimize traffic regulations.
